How to Crack This Challenge
To tackle this challenge successfully, follow these steps:

Data Pre-processing

Handle Missing Values: Identify and impute or remove missing values.
Normalize/Scale Numerical Data: Standardize numerical features to improve model performance.

Model Development

Use machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost for demand forecasting.
Implement LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for capturing time-series dependencies.
Utilize LightGBM for efficient and fast gradient boosting.

Training and Optimization

Apply Grid Search or Random Search for hyperparameter tuning.
Train models using historical data to capture trends, seasonality, and sales patterns.
Use cross-validation to assess model performance and avoid overfitting.

Validation and Testing

Ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
Generate predictions for the test dataset in the required format for submission.
For our subscribers, a starter notebook will be available to guide you through data pre-processing and basic model building. You can customize and enhance this framework to develop your solution further.
